  to return the structured versions of errors.

  Data APIs migration guide for core protocol version information.)

- Batch fetches now always disable shouldIgnoreUnknownXML so that the results
  in the batch feed can be used for updates.

- The shouldIgnoreXML flag is now settable in individual tickets.

- Made object properties dictionaries more KVO-compliant (thanks mtonkin.)

- GDataHTTPFetcher dated data cache now is bounded in size (by default, 15 MB
  for Mac, 1 MB for iPhones) making it suitable for use on iPhones

- GDataHTTPFetcher now takes a GDataFetchHistory class rather than a mutable
  dictionary as the optional fetch history

- The service progress callback now takes a ticket as its first parameter
  rather than a progress monitor input stream, as progress monitoring
  no longer requires that input stream on iPhone 3.0 and Mac OS X 10.5.8
  
- Rather than warn about an omitted user agent, the library just quietly
  defaults to the bundle ID instead.  Library users no longer need to call

Changes since 1.6.0

Additions

- Added Google Health classes

- Added YouTube user event activity classes

- Added Calendar guest elements and inlinecomments query parameter

- Contacts sample updated to optionally fetch only the MyContacts group.

Changes

- Calendar now defaults to service version 2.1, which slightly changes
  responses and response codes from 2.0.
  http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/changelog.html

- Release builds on iPhone now compile out the elaborate descriptions
  for each GDataObject.  Developers can set GDATA_SIMPLE_DESCRIPTIONS
  in their projects to control this behavior.

- Release builds on iPhone now compile out the http logging code.
  Developers can set STRIP_GDATA_FETCH_LOGGING in their projects to control
  this behavior.
  
- The GDataXMLNode xml shim now registers the topmost namespaces for XPath
  resolution.

- Various internal refactoring for improved code readability and
  maintainability.

- For parsing performance, unknown elements and attributes are now removed from
  GDataObjects by comparing only object pointers, not the underlying XML.

- For parsing performance, GDataObject extension declarations are cached
  rather than duplicated in each object.

- To reduce memory usage, GDataObject extensions are stored in arrays only
  when there is more than one instance of an extension class.

- To reduce memory usage, GDataXMLNode now caches all generated NSStrings,
  and returns nil instead of empty arrays on getters. This may deviate from
  NSXML semantics of returning empty arrays.

- GDataOrganization setters now filter out empty string org names and titles.

Bugs Fixed

  for faster feed parsing on iPhone by ignoring unexpected XML, but requiring
  that entries from such feeds must be individually fetched by the client 
  before being updated.

- Added explanatory server error text as NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey to
  server-generated NSErrors so that logged errors are more useful.
  
- Added Optional group to project common sources to more easily identify
  non-service specific sources which may be omitted. ACL classes are now
  optional.  Media classes are now required only for YouTube and Photos classes.
